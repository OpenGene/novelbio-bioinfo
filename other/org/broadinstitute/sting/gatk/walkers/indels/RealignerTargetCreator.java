/**
 * Emits intervals for the Local Indel Realigner to target for realignment.
 *
 * <p>
 * The local realignment tool is designed to consume one or more BAM files and to locally realign reads such that the number of mismatching bases
 * is minimized across all the reads. In general, a large percent of regions requiring local realignment are due to the presence of an insertion
 * or deletion (indels) in the individual's genome with respect to the reference genome.  Such alignment artifacts result in many bases mismatching
 * the reference near the misalignment, which are easily mistaken as SNPs.  Moreover, since read mapping algorithms operate on each read independently,
 * it is impossible to place reads on the reference genome such that mismatches are minimized across all reads.  Consequently, even when some reads are
 * correctly mapped with indels, reads covering the indel near just the start or end of the read are often incorrectly mapped with respect the true indel,
 * also requiring realignment.  Local realignment serves to transform regions with misalignments due to indels into clean reads containing a consensus
 * indel suitable for standard variant discovery approaches.  Unlike most mappers, this walker uses the full alignment context to determine whether an
 * appropriate alternate reference (i.e. indel) exists.  Following local realignment, the GATK tool Unified Genotyper can be used to sensitively and
 * specifically identify indels.
 * <p>
 *     <ol>There are 2 steps to the realignment process:
 *     <li>Determining (small) suspicious intervals which are likely in need of realignment (RealignerTargetCreator)</li>
 *     <li>Running the realigner over those intervals (see the IndelRealigner tool)</li>
 *     </ol>
 *     <p>
 * Important note 1: the input BAM(s), reference, and known indel file(s) should be the same ones to be used for the IndelRealigner step.
 * <p>
 * Important note 2: when multiple potential indels are found by the tool in the same general region, the tool will choose the most likely
 * one for realignment to the exclusion of the others.  This is a known limitation of the tool.
 * <p>
 * Important note 3: because reads produced from the 454 technology inherently contain false indels, the realigner will not currently work with them
 * (or with reads from similar technologies).   This tool also ignores MQ0 reads and reads with consecutive indel operators in the CIGAR string.
 *
 * <h3>Input</h3>
 * <p>
 * One or more aligned BAM files and optionally one or more lists of known indels.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Output</h3>
 * <p>
 * A list of target intervals to pass to the Indel Realigner.
