/**
 * Emits a data file containing information about callable, uncallable, poorly mapped, and other parts of the genome
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * A very common question about a NGS set of reads is what areas of the genome are considered callable. The system
 * considers the coverage at each locus and emits either a per base state or a summary interval BED file that
 * partitions the genomic intervals into the following callable states:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>REF_N</dt>
 * <dd>the reference base was an N, which is not considered callable the GATK</dd>
 * <dt>PASS</dt>
 * <dd>the base satisfied the min. depth for calling but had less than maxDepth to avoid having EXCESSIVE_COVERAGE</dd>
 * <dt>NO_COVERAGE</dt>
 * <dd>absolutely no reads were seen at this locus, regardless of the filtering parameters</dd>
 * <dt>LOW_COVERAGE</dt>
 * <dd>there were less than min. depth bases at the locus, after applying filters</dd>
 * <dt>EXCESSIVE_COVERAGE</dt>
 * <dd>more than -maxDepth read at the locus, indicating some sort of mapping problem</dd>
 * <dt>POOR_MAPPING_QUALITY</dt>
 * <dd>more than --maxFractionOfReadsWithLowMAPQ at the locus, indicating a poor mapping quality of the reads</dd>
 * </dl>
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Input</h2>
 * <p>
 * A BAM file containing <b>exactly one sample</b>.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Output</h2>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>-o: a OutputFormatted (recommended BED) file with the callable status covering each base</li>
 * <li>-summary: a table of callable status x count of all examined bases</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <pre>
 *     -T CallableLociWalker \
 *     -I my.bam \
 *     -summary my.summary \
 *     -o my.bed
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * would produce a BED file (my.bed) that looks like:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *     20 10000000 10000864 PASS
 *     20 10000865 10000985 POOR_MAPPING_QUALITY
 *     20 10000986 10001138 PASS
 *     20 10001139 10001254 POOR_MAPPING_QUALITY
 *     20 10001255 10012255 PASS
 *     20 10012256 10012259 POOR_MAPPING_QUALITY
 *     20 10012260 10012263 PASS
 *     20 10012264 10012328 POOR_MAPPING_QUALITY
 *     20 10012329 10012550 PASS
 *     20 10012551 10012551 LOW_COVERAGE
 *     20 10012552 10012554 PASS
 *     20 10012555 10012557 LOW_COVERAGE
 *     20 10012558 10012558 PASS
 *     et cetera...
 * </pre>
 * as well as a summary table that looks like:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *                        state nBases
 *                        REF_N 0
 *                     PASS 996046
 *                  NO_COVERAGE 121
 *                 LOW_COVERAGE 928
