/**
 * Wrapper class for iterators over ROD objects. It is assumed that the underlying iterator can only
 * perform standard next() operation, which advances it to the next ROD in the stream (i.e. reads the data file
 * line by line). This iterator 1) shifts the focus from record-based traversal to position-based traversal,
 * and 2) adds querying seekForward() method.
 *
 * Namely, this iterator's next() method advances not to the next ROD in the underlying stream, but to the next
 * genomic position covered by (at least one) ROD, and returns all RODs overlapping with that position as a RODRecordList
 * collection-like object. Similarly, when seekForward(interval) is called, this iterator skips all the RODs from the
 * underlying stream, until it reaches specified genomic interval, and returns the list of all RODs overlapping with that interval.
 *
 * NOTE: this iterator has a STATE: next() operation is not allowed after a seekForward() to a non-point (extended) interval
 * of length > 1. Such a call would leave the iterator in an inconsistent state. seekForward() can always be called after
 * either seekForward() or next() (as long as usual ordering criteria are satisfied: the query interval location can neither
 * start before the current position, nor end before the previous query end). seekForward to an interval of length 1
 * reenables next() operation.

    //                     --------------- query 3
    //
    // If we query first for interval 1, both record 1 and record 2 will be loaded.
    // Query for interval 2, on the other hand, should return only record 1, but after
    // query 1 was performed, record 2 is already loaded from the file. If, on the other hand,
    // we try to un-load it from memory, we won't be able to read it again. Hence query 2 is not
    // allowed after query 1. Note also, that curr_query_end is not equivalent to max_position:
    // the latter only tracks where currently loaded records end (and hence helps to re-load records);
    // after query 1 is performed, max_position will be the end of record 2, but query 3 is still
    // perfectly legal after query 1.
    //
    // IMPORTANT NOTE: it follows from the above discussion and example that next() is illegal after ANY
    // seek-forward query EXCEPT those that are performed with length-1 intervals (queryInterval.start=queryinteval.stop).
    // Indeed, in the example above, after, e.g., query 1 is performed, the iterator is "located" at the start
    // of interval 1, but record1 and record 2 are already loaded. On the other hand, a subsequent call to next() would
    // need to shift iterator's position by 1 base and return only record 1.
    //
    // This implementation tracks the query history and makes next() illegal after a seekforward query of length > 1,
    // but re-enables next() again after a length-1 query.
