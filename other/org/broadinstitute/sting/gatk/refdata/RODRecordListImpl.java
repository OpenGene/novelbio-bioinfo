     * in this object), however, the data elements will be copied into a newly
     * allocated list, so that the 'data' collection argument can be modified afterwards without affecting the state
     * of this record list. WARNING: this constructor is (semi-)validating: passed name and location
     * are allowed to be nulls (although it maybe unsafe, use caution), but if they are not nulls, then passed non-null GATKFeature data
     * elements must have same track name, and their locations must overlap with the passed 'location' argument. Null
     * data elements or null 'data' collection argument are allowed as well.
