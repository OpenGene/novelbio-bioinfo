/**
 * This is a utility class, its sole purpose is to populate PlatformUnitFilter with data. When a command line argument
 * (@Argument) of the type PlatformUnitFilterHelper is declared in an application (walker), its constuctor
 * PlatformUnitFilterHelper(String) automatically called by the argument system will parse its String argument
 * and set up static fields of PlatformUnitFilter object.
 *
 * The String argument can be either a name of existing file, or a list of comma-separated lane (Platform Unit) names.
 * First, the constructor will check if a file with specified name exists. If it does, then it is assumed that each line
 * in the file contains one name of a lane (Platfor Unit) to filter out. If such file does not exist, then the argument is
 * interpreted as a comma-separated list. Blank spaces around lane names are allowed in both cases and will be trimmed out.
 *
 * In other words, all it takes to request filtering out reads from specific lane(s) is
 *
 * 1) declare filter usage in the walker
 *
 * @ReadFilters({PlatformUnitFilter.class,...})
 *
 * 2) specify the argument that will take the list of lanes to filter:
 *
 * @Argument(fullName="filterLanes", shortName="FL", doc="all specified lanes will be ignored", required=false)
 *   PlatformUnitFilterHelper dummy;
 *
 * After that, the walker can be invoked with "--filterLanes 302UBAAXX090508.8,302YAAAXX090427.8" argument.
