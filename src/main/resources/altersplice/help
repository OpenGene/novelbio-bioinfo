cash version 2.2.2
-----------------------------
Usage: java -jar -Xmx10g cash.jar <options> --Case:prefix1 case.bam --Control:prefix2 Control.bam --GTF genes.gtf --Output outFilePrefix

Example: java -jar -Xmx10g cash.jar --Case:Mutation file1.bam,file2.bam --Control:WildType file3.bam,file4.bam --GTF genes.gtf --Output outFilePrefix

Or GUI interface is obtained by running: java -jar -Xmx10g cash.jar --GUI

-------------------------
Required parameters 
-------------------------
Input:
--Case:prefix1 sorted and indexed case bam files, using comma to separate replicated samples. 
	e.g. --Case:KO /home/user/ko1.bam,/home/user/ko2.sorted.bam
--Control:prefix2 sorted and indexed control bam files, using comma to separate replicated samples. 
	e.g. --Control:WT /home/user/wt1.bam,/home/user/wt2.sorted.bam
　　Note: indexed file (bai file) can be absent if the parameter "--runSepChr" is set to be False.
--GTF genes.gtf
CASH needs reference gene annotations (eg. gtf/gff file) and RNA-seq data to construct alternative splicing (AS) model within genes
--Output outFilePrefix
	Output directory and prefix, e.g. --Output /home/user/myresult

-------------------------
Optional parameters 
-------------------------
--MergePval A/G, default is G
	Default value (G) reports more sensitive results and value A reports more specific results.
	A: arithmetic weighted mean of event-centric strategy and exon-centric strategy Pvalues (more specific)
	G: geometric weighted mean of event-centric strategy and exon-centric strategy Pvalues (more sensitive)

--Combine True/False, default is False
	False: if here are several replications, CASH treats them as biological replicates as usual
	True: if here are several replications, CASH combines case (control) bam files to be one case (control) big bam file

--DisplayAllEvent True/False, default is True
	A gene may have several AS events on different exons, CASH can display all events (True), or display only one most significantly differential one (False)

--StrandSpecific F/R/NONE, default is NONE
	When the sequence library is strand specific, the parameter is used
	F: first read of the pair-end reads represent the strand of the fragment, just like ion proton
	R: second read of the pair-end reads represent the strand of the fragment

--SpliceCons True/False, default is True
	SpliceCons is used to construct AS model based on RNA-seq data and reference gene annotations, leading to detection of novel AS events in the samples
	True: constructing AS model based on RNA-seq data and gtf/gff files needs more time
	False: employing AS model inferred from gtf/gff file 

--JuncAllSample int, default is 25
	Doesn't calculate AS event with the sum of all sample junction reads less than JuncAllSample
	
--JuncOneGroup int, default is 10
	Doesn't calculate AS event with one group of junction reads less than JuncOneGroup

--minAnchorLen/-A int, default is 5
	When counting junction reads, exon-exon junctions spanned by reads with at least this many bases on each side
	
--minIntronLen/-I int, default is 25
	The gaps between RNA-Seq reads with length > 25bp is considered to be intron
	
--minJuncReadsForNewIso/-J int, default is 10
	Min junction reads for reconstructing AS site
	
--runSepChr True/False, default is True
	Due to some species (e.g. Hordeum vulgare) chromosomes with a huge length of base pairs, the java module 'htsjdk (v2.9.0)' can hardly support the index of the chromosomes and to fix the issue, we added this parameter and users can set this parameter to be False, which means CASH run without index files, but it will take more memory and more computing time.
	 
--ChrRegion chrID/chrID:startPos-endPos
	While runSepChr is True (default), the users can set this parameter and CASH will only calculate AS events within this chromosome/region. The parameter can be set like: "--ChrRegion chr1" or like: "--ChrRegion chr1:1-9527".
